                <h5> Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h5>
                <p> The name of the author of this great novel is Sing Shong. A novel called Three Ways to Survive in a Ruined World (written by the anonymous author tls123) has been written and published over the course of a decade, and Kim Dokja is the sole reader who has followed it to its ending. When the real world is plunged into the premise of Ways of Survival, Kim Dokja's unique knowledge of the novel becomes vital to his survival. Kim Dokja allies with Yoo Joonghyuk, the protagonist of Ways of Survival, in order to change the novel's original plot and more quickly approach the end of the story. As Kim Dokja and his party members progress through the scenarios, they face increasingly difficult threats and life-or-death challenges, struggling to stay alive and work together as they aim to destroy the Star Stream that demands their suffering.</p>

                <h5> Trash of The Count's Family</h5>
                <p> The name of the author of this great novel is Yoo Ryeo Han. Kim Rok Soo has just started reading The Birth of a Hero, a fantasy series about a Korean teenager named Choi Han who gets transported to a fantasy world of magic, monsters, elves, and dragons that's about to be thrown into chaos through a war. <br><br> He gets five volumes in before he falls asleep... and when he wakes up, finds that he's been transported into the world during the time of the first novel.

                    He's also been reincarnated into the body of a minor antagonist from the first novel, Cale, who is known as the trash of the count's family because of his tendency to get drunk and hurl bottles at anyone nearby, as well as treating those of lower status like they aren't people. And he's just days away from when this character is beaten to a bloody pulp by Choi Han. <br><br>This meeting starts Choi Han's journey to heroism, but Kim Rok Soo-as-Cale understandably doesn't want to get hurt.
                    
                    Our new Cale, who didn't have much in Korea, has decided to take advantage of his new position. He'll use his reputation as a piece of trash to do whatever he wants, use his knowledge of the plot keep himself from getting beat up by Choi Han while pointing Choi Han in the right direction to start his journey, then save a bunch of money and get himself protection so he can live an easy life out of the way of the war that's about to start. <br><br>Unfortunately, just by not getting beat up he's already changed the plot enough that he gets deeply involved. And since he only had knowledge up through the first 5 volumes of the series, there are a lot of dangers he still doesn't know about...</p>

                <p> The name of the author of this great novel is Shin Noah. After the Tower suddenly appeared, individuals who wished to pursue their personal values began to inhabit it, coming to be called "hunters."

Kim Gong-Ja, a weak F-Class hunter without any skills, is envious of those who were blessed by the Tower. Letting his jealousy overcome him one day, Gong-Ja abruptly receives a S-Class skill that allows him to copy a skill from someone elseâ€”after they kill him.</p>
